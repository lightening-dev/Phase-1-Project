## About this project 

This project, can be thought of as a mini test. Once the DOM is loaded in the browser, you will see 4 different catagories. Your job, as a user, will be to select a movie from the dropdown list. 
Then, you will choose it's appropriate genre. 
If you succeed in choosing the correct genre, you will see the image of the movie rendered to the browser. If you fail, you will be greeted with a message to try again.
